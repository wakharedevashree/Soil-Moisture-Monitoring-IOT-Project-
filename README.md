Features – Smart Soil Moisture Monitoring Dashboard
📡 Real-Time Soil Moisture Monitoring
Continuously collects and displays moisture levels using capacitive soil moisture sensors.


⚙️ Automated Irrigation Control
Water pump automatically triggers via relay when soil moisture falls below a specified threshold (e.g., <50%).

💧 Water pH & Suitability Analysis
Determines water suitability (acidic/neutral/alkaline) using pH sensor data.

🌤️ Weather API Integration (Optional - for AI extension)
Connects with OpenWeather API for environmental context and future scope predictive irrigation.

📊 Cloud Dashboard with ThingSpeak
Real-time data visualization and analytics for farmers via a cloud-based platform.

📲 Remote Access & Alerts
Farmers receive alerts and monitor soil conditions from anywhere.

🔋 Low-Power & Renewable Ready
Supports solar-powered operation for off-grid locations (future enhancement).

📈 Water Usage Optimization
Saves 25–35% water through intelligent, need-based irrigation.

📉 Error-Calibrated Accuracy
Moisture readings validated against lab results with ±2.1% error margin.
